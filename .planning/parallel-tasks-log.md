# Parallel Autonomous Tasks — Monitor Log

**Watcher:** `claude/monitor-parallel-tasks-pIjpH`
**Policy:** refresh every 6 min · read + verify HANDOFF freshness · note blockers · never merge branches without explicit user sign-off
**Baseline:** `5476fac` — Phase 0 planning complete (shared ancestor of both tracks)

---

## Tracks under watch

| Track | Branch | Role |
|---|---|---|
| A · Substrate | `main` | Phase 0.5 substrate build (validator · icons · atlas · pipeline · tests) |
| B · Autonomy | `landing/coming-soon` | Landing page + 4-hour reentrant Academy Forge loop + vendored content |

## Tick 0 — 2026-04-18 22:29Z (baseline snapshot)

### Track A — `main` @ `50a923c` (7 min ago)
- `355c873` feat(validator): six-slots.js + 6 golden fixtures (Phase 0.5 #1-3)
- `40ab09c` feat(icons): 6 Fuller synergetics SVGs (Phase 0.5 #5)
- `8e8b9e5` feat(atlas): tokens-applied shell + web-components + keyboard + XP (Phase 0.5 #4,6,7,8,9)
- `50a923c` feat(pipeline+tests): extract.ts skeleton + Playwright + Lighthouse + axe (Phase 0.5 #10,11,12) **← HEAD**
- Phase 0.5 build list status: **9 of 12 items landed** (#1-12 except `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- HANDOFF.md on `main`: 279 lines, dated 2026-04-18, describes full Phase 0.5 plan. **Last updated field stale vs. work completed** — does not yet reflect landed #1-#12.

### Track B — `landing/coming-soon` @ `59903da` (11 min ago)
- `9a183ef` landing: brand showcase + roadmap teaser, ready to deploy
- `efc9c1d` docs: vendor Claude Code skills + agents for remote work
- `5a6a594` fix(vendor): inline codebase-to-course (was accidentally a submodule pointer)
- `9282ba6` feat(autonomy): 4-hour reentrant Academy Forge loop, sandbox-self-contained
- `59903da` docs: META-PROMPT.md at root + HANDOFF.md as single entry point **← HEAD**
- Added: `META-PROMPT.md`, `autonomy/{META-PROMPT.md,README.md,run.sh,loop-state.seed.json,work-queue/priorities.yaml}`, `content/sources/{barque,halcon,meta-prompting-plugin}/…`
- HANDOFF.md on `landing/coming-soon`: rewritten as single entry point → "Read META-PROMPT.md and HANDOFF.md. Run `./autonomy/run.sh --hours 4`."

### Divergence
- Both tracks branch from `5476fac`; 4 commits on A, 5 on B.
- No overlap in touched paths yet (A = `validators/ atlas/ pipelines/ tests/`; B = root docs + `autonomy/` + `content/sources/`).
- **No merge conflicts projected** based on current file sets, but `HANDOFF.md` is edited on both sides and WILL conflict when integrated. Flag for user decision at sync time.

### Handoff freshness check
- `HANDOFF.md` on `main` → describes Phase 0.5 plan; work has advanced past it. **Needs a "progress snapshot" update** to reflect landed items.
- `HANDOFF.md` on `landing/coming-soon` → fresh (rewritten at tip commit). **OK.**
- `.planning/progress.md` on `main` → still says "Awaiting human sign-off"; stale vs. landed commits. **Needs refresh.**

### Blockers / risks
- None yet. Both tracks committing cleanly. No open PRs.
- Divergent `HANDOFF.md` is the only integration risk currently visible.

### Actions queued
- Watcher will tick every ~6 min; log appended below.
- If either track stops committing for > 18 min (3 missed ticks) → flag as stalled in log.
- If `HANDOFF.md` on whichever branch ends up being the "trunk" is > 30 min behind HEAD commits → flag as stale.
- On interrupt / handoff: next session must read THIS file first, then the `HANDOFF.md` on both branches, reconcile, and keep appending ticks.

<!-- APPEND NEW TICKS BELOW THIS LINE -->

## Tick 1 — 2026-04-18 22:37Z

- Track A · `main` @ `50a923c` (14 min old) — **no new commits** since Tick 0.
- Track B · `landing/coming-soon` @ `59903da` (19 min old) — **no new commits** since Tick 0.
- No new or deleted branches.
- **Stall status:** neither track past 18 min threshold yet. Track A: 14m quiet · Track B: 19m quiet (1m over threshold for B — watch next tick).
- **HANDOFF.md forensics:**
  - `git log -- HANDOFF.md` on **both** `main` and `landing/coming-soon` shows last touch = `5476fac` ("Phase 0 planning complete"), ~2h28m ago. Neither branch has modified it since the baseline.
  - Tip commit `59903da` message claims "Rewrite HANDOFF.md as the single operator entry" but `git show --stat` confirms it ONLY added `META-PROMPT.md` (317 lines). Commit-message/diff mismatch.
- ⚠️ **HANDOFF not being updated by workers** — both tracks are committing code but neither has touched `HANDOFF.md` in ~148 min (main) / ~144 min (landing). User-stated requirement ("ensure handoff is being updated") is NOT currently satisfied by the autonomous workers.
- **Risks:** handoff is the hand-off contract for a fresh Claude session; if both workers stop without updating it, next cold-context session will see stale "substrate ready to start" text rather than "#1-12 landed on main / autonomy loop landed on landing". Recommend user intervention or a worker prompt tweak.

## Tick 2 — 2026-04-18 22:43Z

- Track A · `main` @ `50a923c` (20 min old) — **no new commits**. 🛑 **STALLED** (past 18-min threshold).
- Track B · `landing/coming-soon` @ `59903da` (25 min old) — **no new commits**. 🛑 **STALLED** (past 18-min threshold).
- No new or deleted branches. Only `claude/monitor-parallel-tasks-pIjpH` has been pushed to this tick (by this watcher).
- **HANDOFF.md:** still last-touched at `5476fac` on both branches (main: 148m behind HEAD · landing: 144m behind HEAD). **No change.** ⚠️ handoff still not being updated.
- **Assessment:** both autonomous workers appear to have stopped or paused. Neither has produced a commit in the ~20-25 min window since the last observed activity (`50a923c` on main at 22:23Z · `59903da` on landing at 22:18Z).
- **Possible causes:** workers finished their atomic unit and exited as designed (Track B's `autonomy/run.sh` is a reentrant loop — each Claude invocation commits ONE unit then exits); driver may not have relaunched them; or they hit the no-progress / wall-clock cap.
- **Recommendation:** if workers are expected to keep running, check the driver (e.g. `autonomy/run.sh`) logs to see whether it's looping or exited. If they're designed to fire-and-exit, this stall is expected and the user may need to kick the next iteration.

## Tick 3 — 2026-04-18 22:49Z

- Track A · `main` @ `50a923c` (26 min old) — **no new commits**. 🛑 STALLED (3rd consecutive tick with no activity).
- Track B · `landing/coming-soon` @ `59903da` (31 min old) — **no new commits**. 🛑 STALLED.
- No new or deleted branches.
- **HANDOFF.md:** unchanged. main 148m behind HEAD · landing 144m behind HEAD. ⚠️ handoff still untouched since baseline.
- **Status:** extended stall confirmed. No forward progress on either track for 3 ticks (≈18 min of observation). Asked user for direction (observe / investigate driver / stop loop); awaiting guidance.

## Ticks 4–15 — 2026-04-18 22:55Z → 2026-04-19 00:01Z (coalesced: long stall, no change)

Twelve consecutive heartbeats received while the main session was awaiting user direction. Rather than write 12 empty tick entries, coalesced into one catch-up.

- Heartbeats observed: 22:55Z · 23:01Z · 23:07Z · 23:13Z · 23:19Z · 23:25Z · 23:31Z · 23:37Z · 23:43Z · 23:49Z · 23:55Z · 00:01Z (12 ticks over ≈72 min).
- Track A · `main` @ `50a923c` — **zero new commits across the entire window**. Now 98 min quiet. 🛑 DEEP STALL.
- Track B · `landing/coming-soon` @ `59903da` — **zero new commits across the entire window**. Now 103 min quiet. 🛑 DEEP STALL.
- No new or deleted branches (only this watcher pushed: Ticks 0-3 commits on `claude/monitor-parallel-tasks-pIjpH`).
- **HANDOFF.md:** still last-touched at `5476fac` on both branches. main: 148m behind HEAD · landing: 144m behind HEAD. ⚠️ handoff still NOT being updated by either worker.
- **Interpretation:** both autonomous workers have been silent for well over an hour. Consistent with the Track B design ("each Claude invocation is a fresh cold-context session that reads META-PROMPT.md and loop-state.json, executes ONE atomic unit, commits, exits") — if the external driver (`autonomy/run.sh`) isn't looping, workers won't relaunch themselves. Track A has no such driver described, so its single worker may have simply completed its atomic unit and exited too.
- **Verdict:** the parallel-task setup is **NOT currently working** as a continuously-running autonomous system. Either the driver exited / was never started, or the workers finished their scoped work and the user needs to kick the next iteration manually.
- Still awaiting user direction (observe / investigate driver / stop).
